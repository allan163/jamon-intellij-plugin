Jamon is a text template engine for Java , useful for generating
dynamic HTML, XML, or any text-based content.

Some features of Jamon:

 * Jamon has a rich feature set to support encapsulation,
   parameterization, and reuse of presentation logic.

 * You can pass arbitrary objects between templates.  Notably, Jamon
   templates can pass arbitrary dynamic content (i.e. template
   fragments) as parameters to other templates.

 * Templates are compiled into Java and then into bytecode, and are
   used in applications just like any other Java class. This provides
   compile-time type-checking and superior performance. During
   development, however, changes to template sources at runtime
   trigger dynamic retranslation and recompilation of the
   templates. This dynamic recompilation can be turned off for
   production deployment.

 * Jamon is general-use in the sense that it can produce arbitrary
   output format (for example, Enhydra XMLC and Zope are tied to HTML
   or XML). Consider generating text and / or multipart MIME email, or
   program source code.

See the generated HTML documentation for details.
